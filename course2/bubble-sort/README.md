# Elementary Sorting Algorithms
Sorting is the process of rearranging the items in a collection (e.g. arrays) so that the items are in some kind of order.

## Bubble sort
A sorting algorithm where the largest values bubble up to the top.

**Time Complexity**: `O(n)` (`O(1)` in best cases like sorting sorted arrays)

## Selection sort

## Insertion sort
