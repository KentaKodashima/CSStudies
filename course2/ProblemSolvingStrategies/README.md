# Problem solving strategies

## Understand the problem
1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
2. What are the inputs that fo into the problem?
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to thr problem?
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? Do I have enough information to solve the problem?
5. How should I lable the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

## Create concrete examples
1. Start with simple examples
2. Progress to more complex examples
3. Explore examples with empty inputs
4. Explore examples with invalid inputs

## Break it down
Break the problem down into some steps.

## Solve/Simplify
1. Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do
2. Temporarily ifnore that difficulty
3. Write a simplified solution
4. Then incorporate that difficulty back in

## Look back and refactor
### Refactoring questions
- Can you check the result?
- Can you derive the result differently?
- Can you understand it at a glance?
- Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
- Can you improve the performance of your solution?
- Can you think of other ways to refactor?
- How have other people solved this problem?
