# Problem solving strategies

## Understand the problem
1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
2. What are the inputs that fo into the problem?
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to thr problem?
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? Do I have enough information to solve the problem?
5. How should I lable the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

## Create concrete examples
1. Start with simple examples
2. Progress to more complex examples
3. Explore examples with empty inputs
4. Explore examples with invalid inputs

## Break it down
Break the problem down into some steps.
