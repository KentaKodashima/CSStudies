# Data Structures
Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

## Singly Linked List
A data structure that contains a head, tail and length property. Linked lists consist of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null.

### Comparisons with Arrays
#### Lists
- Do not have indices
- Connected via nodes with a next pointer
- Random access is not allowed

#### Arrays
- Indexed in order
- Insertion and deletion can be expensive
- Can quickly be accessed at a specific index

### Time complexity
- Insertion: O(1)
- Removal: O(1) or O(n)
- Searching: O(n)
- Access: O(n)

## Doubly Linked List
Doubly linked lists are almost identical to singly linked lists. However, every node in doubly linked lists has another pointer to the previous node. Therefore, finding nodes can be done in half time of singly linked lists. However, they take up more memory considering the extra pointer.

### Time complexity
- Insertion: O(1)
- Removal: O(1)
- Searching: O(n)
- Access: O(n)
