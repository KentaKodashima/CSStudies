# Elementary Sorting Algorithms
Sorting is the process of rearranging the items in a collection (e.g. arrays) so that the items are in some kind of order.

## Bubble sort
A sorting algorithm where the largest values bubble up to the top.

**Time Complexity**: **O(n)** (**O(1)** in best cases like sorting sorted arrays)

## Selection sort
Similar to bubble sort, but instead of first placing large values into sorted position, it places small values into sorted position.

**Time Complexity**: **O(n<sup>2</sup>)** (because it compares every elements in two arrays with n elementsq)

## Insertion sort
Builds up the sort by gradually creating a larger left half which is always sorted.

**Time Complexity**: **O(n<sup>2</sup>)** (because it compares every elements in two arrays with n elementsq)
