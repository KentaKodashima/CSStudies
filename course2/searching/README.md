# Searching Algorithms

## Linear Search
The method to check every single element in an array until it finds a match. The time complexity is usually `O(n)` because it uses loop.

e.g.:
- indexOf
- includes
- find
- findIndex

## Binary Search
Binary search is a much faster form of search. Rater than eliminating one element, it eliminates half of the remaining elements at a time. However, binary search only works on **sorted arrays**.
