# Problem Solving Patterns

## Frequency counter
Use objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values. This pattern can often avoid need for nested for loops or O(n^2) operations with arrays and strings.

## Multiple pointers
Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition.

It is a very efficient pattern for solving problems with minnimal space complexity.

## Sliding window
This pattern involves creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another.

Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created).

It is very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string, etc.

## Divide and conquer pattern
This pattern involves dividing a data set into smaller chunnk and then repeating a process with a subset of data.

This pattern can tremendously decrease time complexity.
